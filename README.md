This project uses machine learning to predict the severity of road accidents based on weather and environmental data. It was completed as part of my coursework

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that classifies accident severity (levels 1 to 4) using features like location, temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and weather conditions.

I worked with a large dataset of 1.85 million accident records from the US (2016–2023), cleaning and preparing the data before training a Random Forest classifier. To improve performance, I addressed class imbalance and fine-tuned feature selection.

## Tools and Technologies

•	Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

•	Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

•	Development environment: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm

## Key Results
•	Achieved 94.2% accuracy on the test set

•	Analyzed feature importance to understand which factors most influence accident severity

•	Visualized results with confusion matrix and feature importance plots

## How to Use
1.	Download the US Accidents dataset (US_Accidents_Dec20.csv) from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
2.	Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script
3.	Review model performance metrics and visualizations
